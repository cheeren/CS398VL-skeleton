A Quick Note about the License
-----------------------------
This repository is licensed under the MIT license, meaning you are free to do whatever you like with it. When you fork this repository, you can even change the license to be closed source, GPL, whatever. By default, though, the LICENSE.md file included indicates that your fork is also completely open source, and anyone else may modify it at will.


Publishing
----------
You have several options for hosting your project. 

### CS Servers
We hope that we will be getting server space on the CS servers soon. I will update this when that is possible

### Github Pages
This one is easy! You just need to create a `gh-pages` branch and Github will use that for hosting your site. Since you don't really need the `gh-pages branch` locally, you can use the following command to push master to gh-pages. This assumes origin is your fork, not the main repository.

    git push origin master:gh-pages

### Amazon Web Services
Coming soon!
