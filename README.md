CS398VL Project Skeleton
================

A project skeleton for CS398 VL (Visualizing Literature). This was initially created Spring 2014.

Publishing
----------
You have several options for hosting your project. 

### CS Servers
We hope that we will be getting server space on the CS servers soon. I will update this when that is possible

### Github Pages
This one is easy! You just need to create a `gh-pages` branch and Github will use that for hosting your site. Since you don't really need the `gh-pages branch` locally, you can use the following command to push master to gh-pages. This assumes origin is your fork, not the main repository.

    git push origin master:gh-pages

### Amazon Web Services
Coming soon!
